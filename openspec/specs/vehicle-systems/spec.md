## Requirements
### Requirement: Steering Control System
The system SHALL provide steering control through a BTS7960 H-bridge motor driver with hall sensor encoder feedback and software position limits.

#### Scenario: Set steering position by percentage
- **WHEN** SteeringController.setSteeringPercent() is called with value from -100 to +100
- **THEN** the steering actuator moves at full speed toward the corresponding encoder position
- **AND** -100% maps to the calibrated left limit
- **AND** 0% maps to the calibrated center position
- **AND** +100% maps to the calibrated right limit
- **AND** movement stops when the target position is reached (within tolerance)

#### Scenario: Center steering on startup
- **WHEN** the system initializes
- **THEN** the steering actuator SHALL auto-home to a physical limit (stall detection)
- **AND** the encoder SHALL be reset to 0 at the home position
- **AND** the actuator SHALL move to the calibrated center position
- **AND** if no calibration exists, the actuator SHALL remain at the home position

#### Scenario: Enforce software steering limits
- **WHEN** a steering command would move beyond the calibrated left or right limit
- **THEN** the target position SHALL be clamped to the limit
- **AND** the actuator SHALL NOT move past the software limit

#### Scenario: Calibrate steering positions
- **WHEN** steering calibration is triggered via web portal
- **THEN** the system SHALL allow setting center position and right limit at current encoder position
- **AND** left limit SHALL be 0 (home position)
- **AND** calibrated positions SHALL be saved to NVS
- **AND** calibration SHALL persist across reboots

#### Scenario: Steering failsafe
- **WHEN** signal loss is detected or failsafe is activated
- **THEN** the steering actuator SHALL move to the calibrated center position
- **AND** if not calibrated, the actuator SHALL stop immediately

### Requirement: Throttle Control System
The system SHALL provide throttle control through a servo-driven acceleration mechanism.

#### Scenario: Set throttle position by percentage
- **WHEN** ThrottleSystem.setPosition() is called with value from 0 to 100
- **THEN** throttle servo moves to corresponding position
- **AND** 0% maps to idle/closed throttle
- **AND** 100% maps to full throttle

#### Scenario: Return to idle
- **WHEN** ThrottleSystem.idle() is called
- **THEN** throttle servo returns to 0% position
- **AND** throttle remains at idle until new command

#### Scenario: Throttle safety override
- **WHEN** brake system is engaged above threshold (e.g., >50%)
- **THEN** throttle is automatically reduced to idle
- **AND** throttle commands are ignored until brakes release

### Requirement: Transmission Control System

The transmission actuator SHALL use an overshoot-and-return motion profile when
changing gears to ensure full mechanical engagement of the detent.

#### Scenario: Overshoot then return on gear change

- **Given** a gear change is requested to a target gear whose stored position differs
  from the current position by more than `TRANS_POSITION_TOLERANCE`
- **When** `setGear()` is called
- **Then** the actuator first moves to `targetPosition + sign(targetPosition − currentPosition) × TRANS_GEAR_OVERSHOOT` (Phase 1)
- **And** once Phase 1 position is reached, the actuator moves back to `targetPosition` (Phase 2)
- **And** physical-switch confirmation and `saveState()` are unchanged and occur only after Phase 2

#### Scenario: Skip overshoot when already near target

- **Given** the current encoder position is within `TRANS_POSITION_TOLERANCE` of the
  target gear position
- **When** `setGear()` is called
- **Then** no overshoot phase is started; the actuator moves directly to target (or
  stops immediately if already there)

### Requirement: Brake Control System
The system SHALL control braking force through a linear actuator-driven brake mechanism.

#### Scenario: Set brake position by percentage
- **WHEN** BrakeSystem.setPosition() is called with value from 0 to 100

- **THEN** brake actuator retracts to 0% position
- **AND** brakes are confirmed released

#### Scenario: Emergency braking
- **WHEN** BrakeSystem.emergencyStop() is called
- **THEN** brakes are immediately applied to 100%
- **AND** throttle is forced to idle
- **AND** transmission remains in current gear

- **THEN** diagnostic data includes:
  - Front light state (ON/OFF)
  - Light toggle count

### Requirement: Transmission State Persistence
The system SHALL persist the last confirmed transmission state (gear, servo position as float percent, validity flag) to NVS so that the servo can be restored to its last known position after a clean power cycle.

#### Scenario: Mark state invalid at start of gear change
- **WHEN** `TransmissionController::setGear()` is called
- **THEN** `state_valid=false` SHALL be written to NVS before the servo moves
- **AND** a mid-move power loss will therefore result in `state_valid=false` on next boot

#### Scenario: Save confirmed state on gear arrival
- **WHEN** the physical gear switch confirms the target gear is reached (RETURN phase complete)
- **THEN** `state_valid=true`, `state_gear`, and `state_pct` (float percent) SHALL be written to NVS
- **AND** the saved state reflects the servo position at that moment

#### Scenario: Restore servo position and skip autohome on valid state
- **WHEN** the system starts
- **AND** NVS `state_valid=true`
- **THEN** the servo SHALL be commanded to `state_pct` immediately
- **AND** the normal autohome path SHALL be skipped
- **AND** the system SHALL log "Restored transmission state, skipping autohome"

#### Scenario: Fall back to neutral default on invalid or missing state
- **WHEN** the system starts
- **AND** NVS `state_valid=false`, or no state is saved
- **THEN** the servo SHALL be commanded to the neutral default position (`TRANS_GEAR_DEFAULT_NEUTRAL_PCT`)
- **AND** the system SHALL log the reason (invalid flag / no data)

### Requirement: Throttle Boost During Gear Changes
The system SHALL use a PID controller to regulate engine RPM to a configurable target value (`TRANS_GEAR_BOOST_TARGET_RPM`) for the duration of a gear change, overriding SBUS/web throttle commands while active.

#### Scenario: Activate PID boost when gear change starts
**Given** a gear change is initiated (transmission actuator starts moving toward a non-NEUTRAL gear)
**When** `transmission_.needsThrottleBoost()` returns true
**Then** the gear boost PID SHALL be activated
**And** CAN RPM polling SHALL switch to fast mode (`CAN_POLL_INTERVAL_RPM_BOOST`)
**And** PID integral and derivative state SHALL be reset to zero

#### Scenario: PID holds target RPM during gear change
**Given** the gear boost PID is active
**And** CAN engine RPM data is valid
**When** `updateGearBoostPID()` is called each loop iteration
**Then** the PID error SHALL be `TRANS_GEAR_BOOST_TARGET_RPM - currentRPM`
**And** PID output SHALL be mapped to a throttle servo angle
**And** the throttle servo SHALL be set to the PID-computed angle, overriding SBUS/web commands
**And** the integral term SHALL be clamped to prevent wind-up

#### Scenario: PID output clamped to safe throttle range
**Given** the PID is active and computing output
**When** the computed angle exceeds `THROTTLE_MAX_ANGLE` or falls below `THROTTLE_MIN_ANGLE`
**Then** the output SHALL be clamped to `[THROTTLE_MIN_ANGLE, THROTTLE_MAX_ANGLE]`
**And** the integral term SHALL not accumulate further past the clamp boundary (anti-windup)

#### Scenario: Freeze throttle output when CAN data is stale
**Given** the gear boost PID is active
**And** CAN data is invalid or stale
**When** `updateGearBoostPID()` is called
**Then** the throttle SHALL hold its last computed angle
**And** the integral term SHALL NOT accumulate
**And** a warning SHALL be logged (rate-limited)

#### Scenario: Deactivate PID when gear change completes
**Given** the gear boost PID is active
**When** `transmission_.needsThrottleBoost()` returns false (actuator stopped at target gear)
**Then** the PID SHALL be deactivated
**And** CAN RPM polling SHALL revert to normal rate (`CAN_POLL_INTERVAL_RPM`)
**And** throttle control SHALL return to the current SBUS/web command on the next update cycle

#### Scenario: Safety timeout releases PID boost
**Given** the gear boost PID is active
**When** `TRANS_GEAR_BOOST_TIMEOUT` milliseconds elapse since activation
**Then** the PID SHALL be forcibly deactivated
**And** throttle SHALL return to SBUS/web command
**And** a warning SHALL be logged: "[BOOST] Timeout, releasing gear boost PID"

#### Scenario: PID deactivated if engine is not running
**Given** a gear change is initiated
**And** CAN engine RPM is below `ENGINE_RUNNING_RPM_THRESHOLD`
**When** `updateGearBoostPID()` is called
**Then** the PID SHALL NOT activate (engine not running — boosting throttle is unsafe)
**And** the throttle SHALL remain at idle
