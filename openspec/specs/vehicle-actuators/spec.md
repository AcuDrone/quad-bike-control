## Requirements
### Requirement: PWM Servo Control
The system SHALL provide hardware PWM control for servo motors using ESP32 LEDC peripheral.

#### Scenario: Initialize servo with valid configuration
- **WHEN** ServoController.begin() is called with valid pin, channel, and pulse width range
- **THEN** LEDC channel is configured for 50Hz PWM output
- **AND** servo is positioned to default safe position (90 degrees)

#### Scenario: Set servo angle
- **WHEN** ServoController.setAngle() is called with angle between 0-180 degrees
- **THEN** pulse width is calculated and applied to LEDC channel
- **AND** servo moves to target angle within 100ms

#### Scenario: Set servo pulse width directly
- **WHEN** ServoController.setMicroseconds() is called with valid pulse width
- **THEN** LEDC duty cycle is set to generate requested pulse width
- **AND** pulse width is constrained to configured min/max range

#### Scenario: Disable servo output
- **WHEN** ServoController.disable() is called
- **THEN** PWM output is stopped
- **AND** servo holds last position or relaxes based on servo type

### Requirement: BTS7960 Motor Driver Control
The system SHALL use a BTS7960 motor driver for the brake actuator, driven through `BTS7960Controller` with LEDC PWM on RPWM/LPWM. The steering actuator SHALL NOT use `BTS7960Controller`; it is driven by a VESC over UART (see "VESC Brushed-DC Steering Driver"). Transmission control remains on a PWM servo.

#### Scenario: BTS7960 for brake actuator
- **WHEN** the brake actuator is commanded via `BTS7960Controller::setSpeed()`
- **THEN** RPWM/LPWM PWM outputs SHALL be set as specified in the existing brake scenarios
- **AND** RPWM and LPWM SHALL never be driven high simultaneously
- **AND** the outputs SHALL be `PIN_BRAKE_LPWM` (GPIO6) and `PIN_BRAKE_RPWM` (GPIO7) routed to
  connector X7

#### Scenario: Steering no longer uses BTS7960
- **WHEN** the steering actuator is commanded
- **THEN** the command SHALL be issued through the `IMotorDriver` abstraction backed by the VESC UART driver
- **AND** no `BTS7960Controller` instance SHALL be associated with the steering actuator

#### Scenario: Former steering PWM pins are reallocated, not reserved
- **WHEN** the pin map is read
- **THEN** GPIO17 and GPIO18 SHALL be allocated to the MAVLink UART1 (TX and RX respectively)
- **AND** the former steering PWM constants and their LEDC channel constants SHALL be deleted rather
  than kept as reserved placeholders
- **AND** LEDC channels 6 and 7 SHALL be available for future use with no reservation

### Requirement: Actuator Safety Limits
The system SHALL enforce safety limits on all actuator operations.

#### Scenario: Validate servo angle input
- **WHEN** servo angle is set outside 0-180 degree range
- **THEN** value is clamped to valid range
- **AND** warning is logged

#### Scenario: Validate motor speed input
- **WHEN** motor speed is set outside -255 to +255 range
- **THEN** value is clamped to valid range
- **AND** warning is logged

#### Scenario: Emergency stop all actuators
- **WHEN** emergency stop function is called
- **THEN** all servo PWM outputs are disabled
- **AND** all BTS7960 drivers are set to coast (both PWM = 0)
- **AND** the steering VESC driver is commanded to zero duty (coast)
- **AND** system enters safe state requiring explicit reset

**Note**: BTS7960 enable pins are hardwired, so the brake driver cannot be fully disabled and coasts to a stop. The steering VESC releases the motor (coast) when commanded to zero duty and also releases automatically on its own configured comm timeout if commands stop.

### Requirement: Hardware Configuration
The system SHALL define all hardware pin assignments in centralized configuration
(`include/Constants.h`), matching the custom `Control_v0` control board (ESP32-S3-WROOM-1U) as
documented in `GPIO_PINOUT_CUSTOM_BOARD_S3.md`. The DevKitC-1 hand-wired pin map SHALL NOT be
supported; there SHALL be exactly one pin map and no board-selection build flag.

#### Scenario: Load pin configuration at startup
- **WHEN** system initializes
- **THEN** all pin assignments are loaded from `Constants.h`
- **AND** pins are validated against ESP32-S3 available GPIO (not ESP32-C6)
- **AND** GPIO19/20 SHALL NOT be assigned any firmware function — they are the native USB data lines
- **AND** GPIO43/44 (UART0) SHALL NOT be assigned any firmware function — they are reserved for the
  future CH9121T wired LAN
- **AND** pin conflicts are checked and reported

#### Scenario: Control_v0 pin assignments
- **WHEN** `Constants.h` is read
- **THEN** the following assignments SHALL be in effect:
  - `PIN_THROTTLE_PWM` = GPIO15 (LEDC channel 1, 50 Hz, X8 pin 2)
  - `PIN_TRANS_SERVO` = GPIO16 (LEDC channel 2, 50 Hz, X8 pin 3)
  - `PIN_MAVLINK_TX` = GPIO17, `PIN_MAVLINK_RX` = GPIO18 (UART1, X9)
  - `PIN_VESC_TX` = GPIO4, `PIN_VESC_RX` = GPIO5 (UART2, X6) — unchanged
  - `PIN_BRAKE_LPWM` = GPIO6, `PIN_BRAKE_RPWM` = GPIO7 (LEDC channels 5/4, X7) — unchanged
  - `PIN_CAN_CS` = GPIO39, `PIN_CAN_SCK` = GPIO40, `PIN_CAN_MISO` = GPIO41, `PIN_CAN_MOSI` = GPIO42
  - `PIN_STEER_SDA` = GPIO1, `PIN_STEER_SCL` = GPIO2 (I2C1 — external header X14, AS5600 only)
  - `PIN_RELAY_SDA` = GPIO48, `PIN_RELAY_SCL` = GPIO47 (I2C2 — on-board expanders U10/U2 + the relay
    board `0x1F` on header X15)
  - `PIN_BOOST_EN` = GPIO46, `PIN_ADC_24V` = GPIO9 (X10)
  - `PIN_CAN_INT` = GPIO38 and `PIN_ADC_IS_MUX` = GPIO3 SHALL be defined but unused

#### Scenario: Functions with no GPIO
- **WHEN** `Constants.h` is read
- **THEN** `PIN_GEAR_REVERSE`, `PIN_GEAR_NEUTRAL`, `PIN_GEAR_LOW`, `PIN_GEAR_HIGH` and
  `PIN_BRAKE_SENSOR` SHALL NOT be defined — those inputs are read from the opto-input expander
- **AND** `PIN_RELAY1`, `PIN_RELAY2`, `PIN_RELAY3` and `PIN_WHEEL_LOCK` SHALL NOT be defined — those
  outputs are driven by the relay-board expander
- **AND** `PIN_STEER_RPWM`, `PIN_STEER_LPWM`, `LEDC_CH_STEER_RPWM` and `LEDC_CH_STEER_LPWM` SHALL NOT
  be defined — GPIO17/18 are now the MAVLink UART
- **AND** no reference to any of these symbols SHALL remain in `src/` or `include/`

#### Scenario: Configure PWM parameters
- **WHEN** PWM peripherals are initialized
- **THEN** servo PWM frequency is set to 50Hz (20ms period)
- **AND** motor PWM frequency is set to 1-20kHz (configurable)
- **AND** PWM resolution is set to 12-16 bits based on frequency
- **AND** LEDC channels 1 (throttle), 2 (transmission), 4 (brake RPWM) and 5 (brake LPWM) SHALL be
  the only channels allocated; channels 3, 6 and 7 SHALL be free

#### Scenario: Wiring document is authoritative
- **WHEN** `Constants.h` and `GPIO_PINOUT_CUSTOM_BOARD_S3.md` disagree about a pin
- **THEN** the document SHALL be treated as authoritative for what the board is physically wired to
- **AND** the divergence SHALL be resolved before the firmware is run on the vehicle

### Requirement: Actuator State Monitoring
The system SHALL track and report current state of all actuators.

#### Scenario: Query servo position
- **WHEN** getCurrentAngle() is called on ServoController
- **THEN** last commanded angle is returned
- **AND** actual position matches command within tolerance (if feedback available)

#### Scenario: Query motor state
- **WHEN** getSpeed() is called on BTS7960Controller
- **THEN** current speed setting is returned
- **AND** direction (forward/reverse/stopped) is indicated

#### Scenario: Check actuator health
- **WHEN** isHealthy() is called on any controller
- **THEN** health status is returned based on last operation success
- **AND** fault conditions are reported (overcurrent, timeout, etc.)

### Requirement: Transmission Servo Control
The transmission servo SHALL use an overshoot-dwell-return motion profile and SHALL enforce sequential gear shifting through the physical order `[R, N, H, L]`.

#### Scenario: Overshoot-and-dwell motion profile
- **WHEN** `setGear(target)` is called
- **THEN** the servo SHALL first move to the overshoot position (`targetPct ± overshootPct`)
- **AND** once servo movement time has elapsed, the controller SHALL enter an overshoot dwell of exactly `TRANS_OVERSHOOT_DWELL_MS` milliseconds
- **AND** after `TRANS_OVERSHOOT_DWELL_MS` elapses, the gear SHALL be assumed engaged regardless of physical sensor state
- **AND** the controller SHALL transition directly to the RETURN phase

#### Scenario: Return phase after assumed gear engagement
- **WHEN** the overshoot dwell period elapses
- **THEN** the servo SHALL move from the overshoot position back to `finalGearPositionPct_`
- **AND** once return movement time has elapsed, the gear change SHALL be marked complete
- **AND** `saveState()` SHALL be called with `state_valid=true`

#### Scenario: Sequential gear shifting — step through sequence
- **WHEN** `setGear(finalGear)` is called
- **AND** `finalGear` is not adjacent to the current gear in the sequence `[R, N, H, L]`
- **THEN** the controller SHALL compute the immediate next step toward `finalGear`
- **AND** `queuedGear_` SHALL be set to `finalGear`
- **AND** the gear change SHALL start toward the immediate next step only

#### Scenario: Sequential gear shifting — advance queue after step completes
- **WHEN** a gear change RETURN phase completes
- **AND** `queuedGear_ != GEAR_UNKNOWN`
- **AND** `targetGear_ != queuedGear_`
- **THEN** the controller SHALL automatically start the next step toward `queuedGear_` using `targetGear_` as the current position
- **AND** steps SHALL continue until `targetGear_ == queuedGear_`
- **AND** `queuedGear_` SHALL be cleared to `GEAR_UNKNOWN` when the final gear is reached

#### Scenario: Sequential shifting interrupted by new command
- **WHEN** `setGear(newFinalGear)` is called while a sequence is in progress
- **THEN** the in-flight gear change to the current intermediate target SHALL complete normally
- **AND** `queuedGear_` SHALL be updated to `newFinalGear`
- **AND** subsequent steps SHALL route toward `newFinalGear`

#### Scenario: Sequential shifting — unknown current gear
- **WHEN** `setGear(finalGear)` is called
- **AND** `targetGear_` is `GEAR_UNKNOWN` or no prior change has completed
- **THEN** the controller SHALL route through `GEAR_NEUTRAL` first (safe intermediate)
- **AND** `queuedGear_` SHALL be set to `finalGear`
- **AND** once NEUTRAL step completes, normal sequencing toward `finalGear` resumes

### Requirement: Steering Motor Driver Abstraction
The steering controller SHALL command its motor through an `IMotorDriver` abstraction exposing `setSpeed(int16_t -255..+255)` and `stop()`, so that the position control loop is independent of the concrete driver.

#### Scenario: Position loop drives through the abstraction
- **WHEN** the steering position control loop computes a drive effort
- **THEN** it SHALL call `IMotorDriver::setSpeed()` with a value in `-255..+255` (positive = wheel right)
- **AND** the existing AS5600 proportional position loop (error → clamped duty) SHALL be unchanged by the driver substitution

#### Scenario: Coast on stop
- **WHEN** the steering controller calls `IMotorDriver::stop()`
- **THEN** the motor SHALL coast (zero drive), matching the prior BTS7960 coast semantics

### Requirement: VESC Brushed-DC Steering Driver
The steering `IMotorDriver` SHALL be implemented by a VESC driver that commands a Flipsky 75200 VESC in brushed-DC motor mode over a dedicated hardware UART using the VESC serial protocol.

#### Scenario: Map speed to duty command
- **WHEN** `setSpeed(speed)` is called on the VESC steering driver
- **THEN** it SHALL send `COMM_SET_DUTY` with `duty = constrain(speed / 255.0, -1.0, +1.0)`
- **AND** `setSpeed(0)` and `stop()` SHALL send zero duty (coast)

#### Scenario: Dedicated UART, isolated from MAVLink
- **WHEN** the VESC driver initializes
- **THEN** it SHALL use `UART_NUM_2` on `PIN_VESC_TX` (GPIO4) and `PIN_VESC_RX` (GPIO5) at `VESC_UART_BAUD`
- **AND** it SHALL NOT use `UART_NUM_1` (MAVLink) or `UART_NUM_0` (debug console)

#### Scenario: Minimal in-repo protocol layer
- **WHEN** the driver frames or parses a VESC packet
- **THEN** it SHALL use an in-repo packet layer implementing VESC short/long framing with a CRC16 check
- **AND** it SHALL implement only `COMM_SET_DUTY` and `COMM_GET_VALUES`

### Requirement: Steering Re-command Guard and Stall Latch
The steering controller SHALL NOT restart its move and stall timers when re-commanded to the current target, and SHALL latch out further motion in a stalled direction for a cooldown, so that stall detection and move timeout function under the continuous MAVLink command stream.

#### Scenario: Re-command within tolerance is a no-op
- **WHEN** `setSteeringPercent()` is called while a move is in progress
- **AND** the new target is within `STEER_RETARGET_TOLERANCE` counts of the current target
- **THEN** `moveStartTime_`, the stall-check timers, and `dutyBoost_` SHALL NOT be reset
- **AND** the in-flight move SHALL continue so the stall window and move timeout can elapse

#### Scenario: Target change beyond tolerance resets the move
- **WHEN** `setSteeringPercent()` is called with a target differing from the current target by more than `STEER_RETARGET_TOLERANCE` counts
- **THEN** a fresh move SHALL start with the move/stall timers reset

#### Scenario: Stall latches out the stalled direction
- **WHEN** a stall-stop occurs (position loop stall, firmware over-current, or a VESC fault)
- **THEN** the controller SHALL record the stalled direction and latch time and stop the motor
- **AND** a subsequent move that would push further in the stalled direction SHALL be refused while less than `STEER_STALL_COOLDOWN_MS` has elapsed

#### Scenario: Opposite-direction escape and post-cooldown retry
- **WHEN** the controller is stall-latched
- **AND** a new move commands the opposite direction (away from or across the jam)
- **THEN** the move SHALL be accepted immediately and the latch cleared
- **WHEN** the controller is stall-latched and a same-direction move is commanded after `STEER_STALL_COOLDOWN_MS` has elapsed
- **THEN** the move SHALL be accepted and the latch cleared

### Requirement: VESC Telemetry Fault Monitoring and Communication Failsafe
The steering controller SHALL poll VESC telemetry to enforce a firmware-level over-current and fault backstop, and SHALL fail safe when the VESC is unresponsive.

#### Scenario: Poll VESC telemetry periodically
- **WHEN** the steering driver is active
- **THEN** it SHALL request `COMM_GET_VALUES` at approximately `STEER_VESC_TELEM_MS` intervals (~2-5 Hz)
- **AND** decode motor current, FET temperature, input voltage, and fault code

#### Scenario: Sustained over-current triggers stall-stop
- **WHEN** decoded motor current exceeds `STEER_VESC_OVERCURRENT_A` for at least `STEER_VESC_OVERCURRENT_MS`
- **THEN** the controller SHALL invoke the stall-stop path (stop + stall latch in the current drive direction)

#### Scenario: VESC fault code stops the motor
- **WHEN** `COMM_GET_VALUES` reports a nonzero VESC fault code
- **THEN** the controller SHALL stop the motor and raise a fault flag in telemetry

#### Scenario: Unresponsive VESC fails safe
- **WHEN** no valid `COMM_GET_VALUES` reply is received for `STEER_VESC_COMM_TIMEOUT_MS`
- **THEN** the driver-ok flag SHALL be set false
- **AND** the motor SHALL be stopped and steering commands (position and jog) SHALL be rejected, mirroring the sensor-fault path
- **AND** normal operation SHALL resume automatically once valid replies return
- **AND** a VESC that is silent at boot SHALL NOT block startup
