## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Telemetry Display on Web Interface
The system SHALL display real-time telemetry on the web interface. Vehicle speed SHALL be displayed
from the hall-effect speed sensor independently of CAN bus status (it is no longer part of the
CAN-gated vehicle-data display).

#### Scenario: Display decoded command values
- **WHEN** a telemetry message with MAVLink command data is received
- **THEN** the decoded command channels (steering, throttle, gear, brake) are displayed
- **AND** normalized values are shown (0-100% or -100 to +100%)
- **AND** values update in real-time when the MAVLink command stream is active

#### Scenario: Display MAVLink link status
- **WHEN** a telemetry message with MAVLink link metrics is received
- **THEN** command rate is displayed in Hz with 1 decimal precision
- **AND** time since last heartbeat and command signal age are displayed (human-readable)
- **AND** link indicators use color coding (green: good, yellow: degraded, red: lost/timeout)

#### Scenario: Display vehicle speed from hall sensor
- **WHEN** a telemetry message containing `vehicle_speed` is received
- **THEN** the vehicle speed is displayed (0-255 km/h) regardless of `can_status`
- **AND** when the accompanying `speed_valid` flag is false the display indicates the reading is
  unavailable/unhealthy rather than showing a misleading 0
- **AND** the value updates in real-time as new telemetry arrives

#### Scenario: Display CAN bus vehicle data
- **WHEN** telemetry message with CAN data is received
- **AND** CAN status is "connected"
- **THEN** engine RPM is displayed (0-16383 rpm)
- **AND** coolant temperature is displayed with color coding:
  - Green: <90°C (normal)
  - Yellow: 90-105°C (warm)
  - Red: >105°C (hot/overheating)
- **AND** oil temperature is displayed with color coding:
  - Green: <110°C (normal)
  - Yellow: 110-130°C (warm)
  - Red: >130°C (hot)
- **AND** throttle position is displayed as percentage (0-100%)
- **AND** CAN data age is displayed (time since last update)
- **AND** vehicle speed is NOT part of this CAN-gated block (it is displayed independently from the
  hall sensor)

#### Scenario: Display CAN disconnected state
- **WHEN** telemetry message has `can_status` != "connected"
- **THEN** CAN card shows "Disconnected" or "No Data" status
- **AND** CAN data values are greyed out or hidden
- **AND** data age shows time since last valid CAN message
- **AND** the hall-sensor vehicle speed display remains active and unaffected

#### Scenario: Display gear transition indicator
- **WHEN** telemetry message has `gear_switching` = true
- **THEN** gear transition indicator is shown with animation (e.g., spinner, loading dots)
- **AND** indicator shows target gear being switched to (e.g., "⚙️ Switching to H...")
- **AND** current gear display does not flash neutral during transition
- **WHEN** `gear_switching` = false
- **THEN** gear transition indicator is hidden
- **AND** stable gear is displayed normally
