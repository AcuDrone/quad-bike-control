## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Throttle Control System
The system SHALL provide throttle control through a servo-driven acceleration mechanism. Throttle
percent SHALL map linearly from the calibrated idle pulse width (0 %) to the calibrated full pulse
width (100 %); the two endpoints MAY be in either order so that a mirrored servo mount (full below
idle) is supported.

#### Scenario: Set throttle position by percentage
- **WHEN** ThrottleSystem.setPosition() is called with value from 0 to 100
- **THEN** throttle servo moves to corresponding position
- **AND** 0% maps to idle/closed throttle
- **AND** 100% maps to full throttle

#### Scenario: Return to idle
- **WHEN** ThrottleSystem.idle() is called
- **THEN** throttle servo returns to 0% position
- **AND** throttle remains at idle until new command

#### Scenario: Throttle safety override
- **WHEN** brake system is engaged above threshold (e.g., >50%)
- **THEN** throttle is automatically reduced to idle
- **AND** throttle commands are ignored until brakes release

#### Scenario: Inverted servo calibration accepted
- **WHEN** a throttle calibration is saved with idle = 2200 µs and full = 800 µs
- **THEN** the calibration SHALL be accepted and persisted to NVS
- **AND** 0 % SHALL command 2200 µs, 50 % 1500 µs and 100 % 800 µs
- **AND** the reported throttle percent SHALL be 0..100 for pulse widths between the endpoints and
  clamped to 0 / 100 outside them
- **AND** the save log SHALL mark the pair as inverted
- **AND** after a reboot the stored inverted pair SHALL be loaded, not replaced by the defaults

#### Scenario: Span check applies to absolute difference
- **WHEN** a throttle calibration is saved or loaded from NVS
- **THEN** it SHALL be accepted only if both endpoints lie within `THROTTLE_SERVO_MIN_US` ..
  `THROTTLE_SERVO_MAX_US` and `|full - idle| >= THROTTLE_MIN_SPAN_US`, regardless of which endpoint
  is larger
- **AND** a rejected save SHALL report "Idle and full must differ by >= 100us"
- **AND** an invalid stored pair SHALL fall back to the default endpoints
