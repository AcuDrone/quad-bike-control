## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Transmission Control System
The transmission control system SHALL enforce the physical gear sequence `[R, N, H, L]` and SHALL govern overshoot and rollback dwell timing via constants in `Constants.h`.

#### Scenario: Gear change routes through sequence
- **WHEN** a gear change command is received (S-bus or web)
- **AND** the target gear is not adjacent to the current gear in sequence `[R, N, H, L]`
- **THEN** the vehicle controller SHALL pass the final target gear to `TransmissionController::setGear()`
- **AND** intermediate gear changes SHALL be handled automatically by `TransmissionController`
- **AND** the telemetry SHALL report the current physical gear at each step

#### Scenario: Constants govern dwell timing
- **WHEN** `TRANS_OVERSHOOT_DWELL_MS` or `TRANS_ROLLBACK_DWELL_MS` are modified in `Constants.h`
- **THEN** the corresponding dwell durations in the transmission state machine SHALL reflect the updated values without additional code changes
