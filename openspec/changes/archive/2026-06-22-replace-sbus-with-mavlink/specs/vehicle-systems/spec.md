## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Multi-Source Command Input Support
The system SHALL accept vehicle control commands from multiple input sources (MAVLink, web
interface) with priority management.

#### Scenario: Apply commands from active input source
- **WHEN** control loop executes
- **THEN** input source priority is evaluated (MAVLINK > WEB > FAILSAFE)
- **AND** commands are read from highest priority active source
- **AND** commands are applied to vehicle systems

#### Scenario: Apply MAVLink commands when link active
- **WHEN** the MAVLink command stream is valid (fresh `SERVO_OUTPUT_RAW` within timeout)
- **THEN** MAVLink commands control steering, throttle, transmission, and brakes
- **AND** web control commands are ignored
- **AND** fail-safe is not active

#### Scenario: Apply web commands when MAVLink inactive
- **WHEN** the MAVLink command stream is invalid or timed out
- **AND** web control commands are available
- **THEN** web commands control steering, throttle, transmission, and brakes
- **AND** commands are validated before application
- **AND** fail-safe is not active

#### Scenario: Apply fail-safe when all sources inactive
- **WHEN** the MAVLink command stream is invalid
- **AND** no web control commands received for >1 second
- **THEN** fail-safe commands are applied to all systems
- **AND** vehicle enters safe state (center steering, idle throttle, NEUTRAL, parking brake)

### Requirement: Input Source Telemetry
The system SHALL provide telemetry about active input source for monitoring.

#### Scenario: Report active input source
- **WHEN** getInputSource() is called
- **THEN** current active input source is returned (MAVLINK/WEB/FAILSAFE)
- **AND** source is updated each control loop cycle

#### Scenario: Include input source in system diagnostics
- **WHEN** VehicleController.getDiagnostics() is called
- **THEN** diagnostic data includes:
  - Current input source
  - Time in current source (seconds)
  - Source switch count (number of source transitions)
  - Last source switch timestamp
